Fig13_merged figure is merged from all of these sims together. For the
script to merge this data together, see the script file kramer_IB_deltapaper_scripts2.
Specifically, see case '13a_merge'.

The corresponding .mat files are on the server. Their names are:
440M	wrkspc_DeltaFig13a_p1.mat
440M	wrkspc_DeltaFig13a_p2.mat
441M	wrkspc_DeltaFig13a_p3.mat
441M	wrkspc_DeltaFig13a_p4.mat
441M	wrkspc_DeltaFig13a_p5.mat
441M	wrkspc_DeltaFig13a_p6.mat
441M	wrkspc_DeltaFig13a_p7.mat
441M	wrkspc_DeltaFig13a_p8.mat
441M	wrkspc_DeltaFig13a_p9.mat

They are huge, so I don't save them.
