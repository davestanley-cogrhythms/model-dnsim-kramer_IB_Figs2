These are some earlier massive 4D sweeps I ran but ended up using for various reasons:
	+ PPnested shift times were not good ("redo" sims)
	+ Resolution wasn't good - highrez resolution increases this, but still  the aspect ratio was not good (too many plots crammed in horizontally), so I redid these. The ones wtihi the new aspect ratio are the ones I'm using in the main folder.
